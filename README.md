### Verilog_Learning_Projects
The module performs binary operations on two n-bit operands and outputs four flags: overflow ("Over_Flow"), carry out ("C_out"), zero ("Zero"), and sign ("Sign"). 
The module supports addition and subtraction modes, selected by the "Add_Sub" input. When "Add_Sub" is logic low ("0"), the module allows the insertion of a carry input (C_in) for addition. Conversely, when "Add_Sub" is logic high ("1"), the module performs subtraction using the two's complement method, without requiring a carry input."
